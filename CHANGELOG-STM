* Tue Oct 14 2008 Sean McGoogan <Sean.McGoogan@st.com> 42
- [Add patch: u-boot-1.3.1_stm23_0038-20081014.patch.gz; Bugzilla: 4465; Bugzilla: 4624; Bugzilla: 4726; Bugzilla: 4806; Bugzilla: 4828]
- Added support for the MB680 (STx7105) board.
  This includes support for the new SoC on the MB680 board, as well
  as the following blocks: Serial (ASC), NOR Flash, NAND Flash, USB
  (OHCI), and ST-GMAC + NS DP83865 PHY.  The following are not supported:
  Serial Flash (SPI), PCI, SATA, EHCI, or any of the other blocks that
  STMicroelectronics does not support in U-boot.
- Added phase I support for STMicroelectronics' MB628 (STx7141)
  This update provides initial (Phase I only) support for the MB628
  board, which uses STMicroelectronics' STx7141 SoC device. Phase II
  will be provided later.
- Include support for latest EPLD revisions on MB618 (STx7111) boards.
  The STMicroelectronics' MB618 (STx7111) board has undergone several EPLD
  revisions in the firmware, and the previous version of U-Boot became
  incompatible with the newer versions.
  This update now supports version 06 (and later) of the EPLD firmware. As
  a result of this change, all versions of the firmware prior to version
  06 (specifically 04 and 05) are no longer supported.  Boards with
  earlier versions of the supported firmware must upgrade to a later
  version to use this patch to U-boot.
  A new configuration macro "CONFIG_SH_NO_EPLD" now exists, which can be
  used to instruct U-Boot to disregard the presence of a EPLD.  This is
  useful for clones of the MB618, which do *not* have a EPLD.
- Ensure Caches are always in Copy-Back mode (CCR.CB==1)
  Prior to this fix, then the following was used: CCR.CB==CCR.WT==0.
  That is, P0 and P3 are in Copy-Back, but P1 was in Write-Through mode.
  However, Write-Through was effectively only enabled in P1 in 29-bit
  mode. In 32-bit mode, the PMB[x].WT==0 dominates, ensuring that we
  were actually in Copy-Back mode in 32-bit mode.
  This update, will set: CCR.CB==1, CCR.WT==0, PMB[x].WT==0.  This will
  always put all cached accesses (P0, P1 and P3) into Copy-Back mode,
  in both 29-bit, and 32-bit modes.
- Added a "progress indicator" when writing to NOR flash devices.
  Modified the flash routines to print a dot (".") character for
  every 16 KiB of data written to NOR flash, as a progress indicator.
  This modification also tidied up some of the diagnostics, to make them
  more consistent, e.g. the use of ellipsis ("...") and "done" strings.
- Improvements to the "bdinfo" command's output for SH boards.
  Tidied up the output from the "bdinfo" command for boards with SH
  devices on them. The code is now structured better; duplicated code
  was removed; and the field width of the various reported parameters
  are now all consistent.
- First attempt at using the new binary prefixes: Ki, Mi, Gi
  This is a first attempt at modifying U-boot to use exclusively the IEC
  recommended binary (2^10) prefixes (e.g. "Ki", "Mi", "Gi"), instead
  of the disapproved SI decimal (10^3) prefixes (e.g. "k", "M", "G"),
  for measuring units of computer memory, disk space, etc.
  This is recommended by the addendum to IEC 60027-2, and the IEEE
  1541-2002 standards.  The traditional SI prefixes should now only have
  a base-10 meaning, and not have any base-2 meaning.
  This modification has been aimed primarily at the SH architecture, and
  all the relevant SH files have been changed appropriately. In addition,
  most architecture agnostic source files have also been modified. As
  a result, all code normally built on SH should now exclusively use
  the appropriate prefixes correctly.
- Print out the OUI with a field width of 6 (was 4)
  The OUI is a 24-bit value, and so it requires a maximum of 6 character
  positions to print it in hex. Previously it was only 4 character
  positions. PHYs which have any bits set in the top octet resulted
  in the output of the "mii info" command being unaligned. This update
  fixes that annoyance.
- Bug fix to include/asm-sh/st40reg.h (ST40_EMI_BANK_ENABLE)
  Fixed a bug that the register offset for ST40_EMI_BANK_ENABLE was
  incorrect.  Instead, an unused macro ST40_EMI_BANKNUMBER had this offset,
  and this (unused macro) has now been removed.
  This bug was originally reported in STMicroelectronics' bare-machine
  tool-set as DDTS #INSbl28111.
  This bug fix is required with boards that need to disable some of the
  EMI banks, due to a lot of NOR flash being present on the board.
- Bug-fix and refactoring of the (STM) ASC serial driver
  This update is a refactoring of the drivers/serial/stm-asc.c ASC driver
  file for the UART used by STMicroelectronics. This was primarily to
  address some confusion/misdirection over the accuracy of the comments,
  which had been reported a few times.  As a result, the comments are
  now correct, and there is a comment for each function, which should
  significantly address the maintainability of the file.
  As a result of the tidying up, some functions have been deleted, and
  (in some cases) recreated in a different guise, further improving the
  readability and maintainability of the driver.
  Code has been commented out, removing the support for the
  anachronistically slower baud rates (below 9600). If required, it can
  be re-enabled!
  Finally, a bug was fixed which had previously resulted in baud rates
  slower than 19200 being mis-configured with the wrong baud rate divisor.
  This has now been fixed, and all supported baud rates have been tested.
  The baud rates now supported are: 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200.
- Added test code to put the PHY into loopback mode.
  Added conditionally compiled code, such that if CONFIG_PHY_LOOPBACK
  is defined, then stm-stmac.c will put the external PHY in loop-back
  mode, for testing purposes. In addition, for all TX and RX packets,
  the frame header will be dumped, to facilitate easier debugging.

* Mon Sep 29 2008 Melwyn Lobo <melwyn.lobo@st.com> 41

* Fri Aug 01 2008 Sean McGoogan <Sean.McGoogan@st.com> 38
- [Add patch: u-boot-1.3.1_stm23_0036-20080801.patch.gz; Bugzilla: 4102; Bugzilla: 4173]
- Support for the following two new boards: MB671 and CB102.
  Both these boards uses STMicroelectronics' STx7200 chip.  This update
  includes testing on both 29-bit and 32-bit (SE) modes.
- Added support for all 256MB of LMI0 RAM (on MB671+CB102) in SE-mode.
  The new MB671+CB102 boards have 256MB of memory in LMI0.  This update
  has refactored the PMB code, such that there are now two contiguous
  128MB PMB entries (instead of just the one) to map the entire 256MB
  of LMI0 memory.  As a result, U-boot will now be located at 0x8FF00000
  on boards with 256MB in LMI0 in SE mode.
  The PMB refactoring has resulted in the following significant changes:
  <p>PMB[0:1] is used to map main memory, and will mostly be used as
  cached, except on initialization, and when passing control to the
  linux kernel, where it will be un-cached.
  <p>PMB[2:3] is an alias for PMB[0:1], except it is guaranteed to
  always be UN-cached. This is required in order that we can safely
  toggle the cacheability of PMB[0:1].
  <p>PMB[0:1]  will map VA 0x80000000 .. 0x8fffffff.  (256MB)
  <p>PMB[2:3]  will map VA 0x90000000 .. 0x9fffffff.  (256MB)
  <p>PMB[4:15] will map VA 0xa0000000 .. 0xbfffffff.  (512MB)
  <p>If sizeof(LMI) <= 128MB, then PMB[1] and PMB[3] are unused,
  i.e. PMB[1].V == PMB[3].V == 0.
  see include/asm-sh/pmb.h for further details.
- A new U-boot command "pmb" has been added.
  This new command, which when run, will display the state of all the
  currently valid PMB entries, in SE-mode. When compiled with the macro
  DEBUG defined, it will also verify adherence to the aforementioned
  refactoring requirements of the PMB.
- Fix incorrect probing of AMD (compatible) CFI flash devices.
  Prior to this fix, CFI flash, compatible with the AMD command set,
  may be miss-probed, and wrongly identified. This changes addresses
  this issue.  Both INTEL and AMD compatible CFI flash devices should
  now be correctly identified.
  For further details, please see:
  https://bugzilla.stlinux.com/show_bug.cgi?id=4102
- Added support for latest revisions of SMSC LAN8700 devices.
  The stm-stmac.c driver has been updated to be tolerant of minor
  revision changes in the PHYID register for both the SMSC LAN8700
  and the STMicroelectronics STe101p.
- Bug fix: added 2 NOP instructions to cpu/sh/start.S
  Added a couple of NOP instructions, to workaround the
  problem reported in the following bugzilla report:
  https://bugzilla.stlinux.com/show_bug.cgi?id=4173
- Pad printed memory sizes with a field width of 3.
  The function print_size() will now pad memory sizes to a field width of 3
  (it was 2). This is required as a lot of boards now have > 99MB of RAM
  on them, and the vertical alignments were inconsistent, when displaying
  the capacity for a board with a lot of RAM, but a small amount of flash.
- Improved debugging of cpu/sh/start.S.
  Some additional descriptive symbols are now defined in cpu/sh/start.S,
  which should facilitate easier debugging of this file.
- Linux Kernel compatibility checking
  Fixed a minor bug in lib_sh/sh_linux.c, whereby the wrong mode was
  reported for both linux & U-boot, if the kernel was inappropriate.
- Numerous minor changes.

* Mon Jul 14 2008 Vinayak Pane <vinayak.pane@st.com> 37
- [Add patch: u-boot-1.3.1_nmdk_001-ethernet.patch]
  Added support for ethernet on ndk20 board. Modified CFG_ENV_OFFSET.

* Tue Jun 10 2008 Sean McGoogan <Sean.McGoogan@st.com> 36
- [Add patch: u-boot-1.3.1_stm23_0034-20080610.patch.gz; Bugzilla: 3665]
- Added support for the MB618 (STx7111) MBoard.
  This update includes support for serial, GMAC, USB, NAND & NOR flashes.
  It has been tested on both 29-bit and 32-bit (SE) modes; both from GDB
  and booting from NOR-flash.
  It should be noted that the MB618 supports both NOR and NAND
  flashes. However, only one may be visible any any one point. Hence,
  it is necessary to re-configure and re-build U-boot, to swap between
  NAND/NOR flash devices.
- This is the first update that includes support for the new SH4-300
  series family of CPU cores.
- Ensure MMU coherency (with RTE) on SE mode-switching
  Previously the code executed 8 NOP instructions, immediately after
  entering 32-bit mode (SE=1).  However, this is not architecturally
  guaranteed (on SH4-300 series cores). Executing an RTE instruction
  instead, is guaranteed to preserve the MMU coherency, on all SH cores.
  This update, replaces the eight NOPs, with an RTE instruction, to
  ensure the MMU coherency, when mode-switching, in all cases.
- Use the on-chip Watchdog to effect a (power-on) reset.
  Prior to this change, the "reset" command was implemented by setting
  SR.BL=1, and issuing a TRAPA instruction.  This update is to use
  the on-chip watchdog timer instead, to effect a power-on-reset. All
  "reset" commands for the SH family, will now use the watchdog as
  the reset mechanism.  As a result of this change, the chip-specific
  st?7???_reset() functions have been all been replaced by a single
  sh_reset() function, which now resides in lib_sh/board.c.
- Enable cachable address for NOR FLASH in 32-bit (SE) mode.
  In 32-bit (SE-mode) added cached aliases for NOR FLASH (in addition
  to the uncached) mappings. The memory map for NOR FLASH is now:
  	Physical:	0x00000000
  	UN-cached:	0xA0000000
  	Cached	:	0xA8000000
  Thus, one can program NOR flash using uncached addresses, and Boot
  using cached addresses.
- Bug fix for CFI FLASH devices.
  Recent reliability improvement patches for CFI FLASH, in particular for
  multi-bank devices, appeared to unintentionally break uni-bank FLASH
  devices. This patch corrects this problem.  In particular it ensures
  that CFI mode is enabled when required, and will use the correct RESET
  command code when required.
- Several minor changes to other files (mostly configuration) have
  been made.  These were just to keep the code as "unified" as possible.

* Wed May 14 2008 Sachin Verma <sachin.verma@st.com> 35
- [Add patch: u-boot-1.3.1_nmdk.patch]

  Change sha1.c which is shared between host and target so that during
  the host tools phase it does not use asm-sh/string.h if the host
  system does not have /usr/include/linux/string.h

* Tue Mar 25 2008 Sean McGoogan <Sean.McGoogan@st.com> 32
- [Update: 1.3.1] Updated to version 1.3.1 for ST40
- [Add patch: u-boot-1.3.1-stm-20080319.patch.gz; Bugzilla: 3665]
- Add support for the CB101 board. The CB101 board is now supported. This
  has been tested (modulo SATA) on both 29-bit and 32-bit systems.
- USB now works on both STb710x and STi7200 chips.  Added support for
  USB Mass-Storage for the STi7200 chip. It should be noted that although
  the STi7200 supports three USB Host Controllers, that only one may be
  used. This is a current restriction of the generic U-boot sources, and
  not the SH port.  Also tidied up the initialisation of USB (and SATA).
  USB mass storage tested, on both 29-bit and 32-bit systems.
- Added initial support for NAND FLASH on the ST40 Silicon.  Added
  initial support added for NAND FLASH for the CB101 board with the
  STx7200 silicon from STMicroelectronics. This has been tested for
  both 29-bit and 32-bit environments, but only on the CB101, with both
  (on-board) NAND chips.  Testing included using the JFFS2 file-system,
  and the "mtdparts" environment variable to define partitions for
  both NAND and NOR partitions.  Performance of this initial version is
  sub-optimal. This version takes no advantage of the caches that are
  available on the SuperH architecture.
- Fix a putative DataToggle Error whilst performing BULK transfers.
  There was a subtle bug with the way that the OHCI data toggle carry
  bitfields were managed. It was possible for the HC and the remote
  device to get out of step with the data toggle values, due to the fact
  that the ED structures were re-used, without saving and restoring the
  ED.C bitfield across this re-use.  This problem was only observed when
  there were multiple (strictly greater than one) BOT USB Mass-Storage
  devices present on the system. The system would sometimes hang, and
  report timeouts. Simply adding or removing a device, or exchanging
  the positions on the bus of two devices could invert the behaviour. It
  initially looked like a random instability.  Due to the fact that only
  a statically defined small number (eight) ED structures were available
  to the HCD to manage all the devices, the EDs were regularly re-used, if
  multiple devices were present. This resulted in the ED.C (toggleCarry)
  bitfield potentially losing its value between two consecutive BULK
  accesses to a single device, if the ED structure was temporarily
  re-used to communicate with a different device. The following simple
  command sequence was enough to provoke it: "usb reset;usb part". This
  modification saves the ED.C bitfield in the usb_device structure, after
  each transaction. It will then invert the hardware visible ED.C for new
  BULK transfers, if a DataToggle error would have otherwise resulted.
  It should be noted that CONTROL transfers were immune from this problem.
- Fix to CFI flash, to support multi-bank devices better.  Fixed a
  problem that occurs with multi-bank devices, whereby, a sector was
  in the wrong mode, and the wrong data was accessed. Now explicit
  calls are made to ensure the sector is in the correct mode prior
  to accessing it.  This should address some of the inconsistencies,
  and reliability issues that were sometimes observed with NOR FLASH
  devices, especially with multi-bank devices.  Without this fix, the
  "protection" status information for a given sector was indeterminate.
- Minor change, so that if/when CFG_MONITOR_LEN changes in the
  configuration file, then $monitor_sec and CFG_ENV_OFFSET will
  automatically track, accordingly. Thus, it should be easier to change
  correctly.
- By default, CB101 and HMS1 now default to allocating 256kB for the
  monitor (2 sectors), with the remaining boards allocating only 128kB
  (1 sector). Typically, enabling USB will require 2 sectors.
- Enabled CFG_FLASH_EMPTY_INFO for all STMicroelectronics boards.
  This useful feature is now enabled, by default, for all supported
  boards from STMicroelectronics. Note the "flinfo" command will be
  slower as a result.
- Experimental Performance improvement for OHCI USB.  Uncommenting the
  following line will remove some delays in the USB sub-system. However,
  it is possible that some of these removed delays may be actually
  necessary on some hardware devices.  So, although this gives a
  useful performance improvement, it does so at the potential risk of
  reliability and stability.  This should be considered as an experiential
  configuration, and not at all recommended for production or deployment
  code, unless it has been thoroughly tested for your specific hardware.
  Enabling this optimisation makes some assumptions, that may be totally
  without any foundation.  If reliability or stability becomes an issue,
  then please disable this configuration option, as a first step.
  Use it at your own peril - strictly caveat emptor!
	#define CONFIG_USB_AGGRESSIVE_MINIMAL_DELAYS
- Ensure that LBA48 is used on both PATA and SATA by default. Also, ensure
  that LBA's are stored in a 64-bit value (fixes compiler warnings).
- Changed default IDE device from PATA to SATA on most boards.
- The list of currently supported boards are:
	mb411, mb442, mb448, mb519, hms1 and cb101.
